## Description

This project is my week two Java IP about Hero Squad App.

## What is Heroes Squad App?
It is an app that allows you to recruit a well-balanced team of superheroes (or any other character-type of your choosing).
Create a Hero object: At the very least, they should have a name, age, special power and weakness. Special powers and weaknesses could be freely assignable, or you may offer users a pre-determined set to choose from.
Create a Squad object: They should have a max size, name, and a cause they are dedicated to fighting (sexism, computer illiteracy, not covering your mouth when you sneeze, hogging bus seats with your backpack, passive-aggressive post-it notes, etc.).
Allow users to assign Heroes to a Squad. Each hero can only participate in one Squad at a time.
You could even calculate scores for a specific skill area for your squad (defense, distance attacks, etc), or begin to integrate a turn-based battle system. Get creative! This could be the start of a fun portfolio piece!

## BDD
The applications allow users to do the following:
* Add a new hero in the squad:-> They should have a name, age, special power and weakness.
* View the heroes List.
* Be able to Delete a created hero.
* Add a new squad.
* When a squad is added :->Should have a max size, Squad name, and a cause they are dedicated to.
* View a list of current squads.
* Be able to delete a Squad.
* Assign a hero to a Squad and not to exceed the maximum size.
* Be Able to search a Hero or a Squad that is already in the Database.

## Steps for the problem
•   As always, follow the "Red, Green, Refactor" workflow. You should always write a test before implementing a new behavior. Keep this lesson open as you code, and follow along with the workflow as you develop the program.
•   First of all before everything, you will want to create a test file to test the functionality of the HeroSquad.
•   In the test file( HeroTest Files & SquadTest Files), you will need to test out if the entered input is appropriate: Only strings. And throws appropriate exceptions. Also, the output is right given the input.
•   The same case applies to Hero and Squad Class files.
•   You'll want to create Hero object class that takes an input and adds it to the Squad of your choice.
•   You'll want to create Squad object class that takes an input and adds it to the Squad of your choice.
•   You will need to create an attribute that holds the Heroes (name, age, special power and weakness) &
Squad inputs (max size, name, and a cause they are dedicated to fighting)as well as the output.


## **Expected output is either**
Eventually, app that allows you to recruit a well-balanced team of superheroes.
* A hero/heroes should have a name, age, special power and weakness.Special powers and weaknesses could be freely assignable, or you may offer users a pre-determined set to choose from.
* A Squad should have a max size, name, and a cause they are dedicated to fighting.
* Allow users to assign Hero to a Squad. Each hero can only participate in one Squad at a time.
* Calculate scores for a specific skill area for your squad (defense, distance attacks, etc), or begin to integrate a turn-based battle system.
